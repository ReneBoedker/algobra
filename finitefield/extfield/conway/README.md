# Algobra: Conway polynomials
This package contains the list of Conway polynomials provided on the homepage of [Frank LÃ¼beck](http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Frank.Luebeck/data/ConwayPol/index.html).

If desired, the package can be used on its own by utilizing `Lookup`, which is the only exported function. The return value is the slice uints representing the coefficients of the Conway polynomial.
