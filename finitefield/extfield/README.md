# Algobra: Extension Fields
This package implements arithmetic in finite fields of any prime power cardinality.

If you need finite fields of extension degree one &ndash; that is, prime fields &ndash; [algobra/primefield](https://github.com/ReneBoedker/algobra/tree/master/primefield) provides a more efficient implementation. If both prime fields and extension fields are needed, consider using [algobra/finitefields](https://github.com/ReneBoedker/algobra/tree/master/finitefield) instead.

## Basic usage
### Arithmetic operations
The Element objects have methods `Add`, `Sub`, `Mult`, and `Inv` for the basic field operations. Of these four, only `Inv` allocates a new object. The other methods store the result in the receiving element object. For instance, `a.Add(b)` would evaluate the sum `a+b`, and then set `a` to this value. If the result is to be stored in a new object, the package provides the methods `Plus`, `Minus`, and `Times`, which evaluate the arithmetic operation and returns the result in a new object.

Additional functions such as `Neg` and `Pow` are also defined. For details, please refer to the documentation.

### Equality testing
To test if two elements `a` and `b` are equal, `a == b` will not work since this compares pointers rather than the underlying data. Instead, use `a.Equal(b)`. In addition, the expressions `a.IsZero()`, `a.IsNonzero()`, and `a.IsOne()` provide shorthands for common comparisons.

### Error handling
In order to allow method chaining for arithmetic operations &ndash; such as `a.Add(b).Mult(c.Inv())` &ndash; the methods themselves do not return errors. Instead, potential errors are tied to the resulting field element, and the error can be retrieved with the `Err`-method. For instance, you might do something like this:
``` go
a:=field.Element(0).Inv()
if a.Err()!=nil {
    // Handle error
}
```
