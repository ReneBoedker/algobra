# Algobra
Algobra is a collection of packages that implement finite field arithmetic as well as univariate and bivariate polynomials over finite fields.

## Installation
To install the full set of packages, you can run
```sh
go get github.com/ReneBoedker/algobra
```
Note that this top-level package does not provide any functionality in itself. It simply imports each subpackage to allow easier installation.
